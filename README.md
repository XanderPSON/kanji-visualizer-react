# Kanji Visualizer in React

<p> This is a simple kanji visualizer written in React. This tool will help you visualize what Japanese kanji you have already learned and to what degree so you know where you stand in your quest to master all 2200 kanji.</p>

# How It Works

<p> For the kanji_connect, click on a kanji to change the color. The colors indicate the degree to which you have memorized the character. The following colors mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>White: Not known at all</li>
<li>Red: Not well known</li>
<li>Orange: So-so</li>
<li>Green: Well known</li>
<li>Blue: Mastered</li>
</ul>

# To Run

```
rails s
```

+ [Kanji_Hover](http://localhost:3000/kanji_hover)
